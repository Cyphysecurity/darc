Redefining the steering (STR) pin
    The code of the Arduino configuration was modified to properly read input signals from the vehicle's steering (STR). Previously,
    the pin was specified incorrectly in the arduino_nano328_node.ino file.
    
Different IMU used
    In the UTD implementation, a Razor M0 IMU was used instead of the myAHRS+ IMU. In order to do this, the Razor M0 IMU driver was
    installed on the Odroid and the hardware references to the IMU in the code were redefined to reflect this.
    
Different webcam used
    In the UTD implementation, a Logitech c920 webcam was used instead of the 

Encoders printed in black so filled in with white out 

Some of the units are incorrect in some of the files

Going from full throttle forward to backward doesn’t get received properly

openLoop_straight.launch

Line 29 → fxR_target Value changed from 0 to 90

Controller_straight.py

step _up → remove /50

Controller_low_level.py

Update_arduino()

Added a function to convert to miliseconds in order to have the 90 value centered at 1500
